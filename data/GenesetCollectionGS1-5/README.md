# Artificial gene set collection


Gene Ids for a subset of genes from the following gene sets were extracted to build a small gene set collection for testing/debugging the pipeline.
Genes that were not present on the hu6800 microarray platform were ignored. A subset of genes, with a predetermined size, were extracted from the remaining genes from each gene set. These subsets were assembled in a way that the artificial gene sets do not have any overlap.

- MODULE_141 (10 genes)
- GO_ALCOHOL_BIOSYNTHETIC_PROCESS (20 genes)
- GO_REGULATION_OF_CYCLIN_DEPENDENT_PROTEIN_KINASE_ACTIVITY (30 genes)
- MORF_PAPSS1 (40 genes)
- E2F_Q3_01 (50 genes)
